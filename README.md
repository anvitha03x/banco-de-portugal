# **Predictive Modeling of Bank Marketing Campaign Success**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign data from **Banco de Portugal** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. By leveraging **machine learning models**, we aim to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer targeting.  

## **Aim of the Project**  
- Develop a **classification model** that predicts the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.  
- Improve **marketing efficiency** by identifying key factors influencing customer decisions.  
- Help banks **reduce costs** by focusing marketing efforts on potential customers who are more likely to convert.  

## **Purpose of the Project**  
- **Analyze customer behavior:** Identify patterns in demographics and past interactions that impact marketing success.  
- **Feature Engineering & Data Processing:** Prepare, clean, and enhance the dataset for improved model accuracy.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use **Random Forest** and other machine learning techniques to classify potential subscribers.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to ensure reliable predictions.  
- **Future Improvements:** Suggest enhancements like real-time data integration, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced ensemble models.  

## **Key Findings & Business Impact**  
- The **Random Forest model** provided strong accuracy in predicting customer subscription decisions.
